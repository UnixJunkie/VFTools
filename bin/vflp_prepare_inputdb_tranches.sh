# Usage information
usage="Usage: vflp_prepare_inputdb_splitting.sh <input files> <create meta-tranch folders>

Summary:
    Sortes the compounds in a file with many molecules into separate files corresponding to the tranches. 
    For each tranch an individual file is created, located in a folder with the meta-tranch (first two letters).

Requirements:
    Has to be run in the root (database) folder which contains the input file.
    The first column contains the SMILES, the second column the compound name, and the third column the tranch name. Columns have to be separated by single spaces. 

Arguments:
    -h: Display this help
    '<input files>': The input files with the compounds (SMILES, name, tranch), separated by a colon ":"
    -<create meta-tranch folders>: true or false. If false, the folders have to exist already.
